**Scenario**
You have just started a new role as a Junior Software Developer at AQ Digital Solutions
(AQDS), an independent software development company that designs and builds bespoke
software solutions for various companies of different sizes that cover a range of different
industries. The software that they design uses a wide range of technologies, from simple
stand-alone programs to large web-based applications.
AQDS has been approached by a small, local company – North Sussex Judo – that specialises
in providing judo training sessions to people from the local community. North Sussex Judo
caters to people of all ages and experience, from expert to beginner.
North Sussex Judo has requested a simple program that will calculate the cost of training fees
for their athletes each month.
The CEO of the company has reviewed the client requirements and has determined that this
is a suitable project for you to take on. The company wants to see how you use and apply the
ADQS development environments and code standards.

The requirements are that North Sussex Judo wants a program that will allow a user to enter
the following information:
• athlete name
• training plan
• current weight in kilograms (kg)
• competition weight category
• number of competitions entered this month
• option to add the number of hours private coaching.

For each athlete, the program should then output the following information:
• the athlete’s name
• an itemised list of all costs for the month
• the total cost of training and competitions for the month
• how their current weight compares to their competition weight category.

North Sussex Judo currently have six athletes enrolled on their training program, but they
would like the ability to register more.
